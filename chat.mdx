Unbounded is a set of an "appless" AIs that you treat just like any other contact in your address book. You can
reach out any time when your friends and family are not available.

The default AI is @emmy.ai, a friendly and empathetic AI companion you can use via the web, email, or text messaging.
If text messaging you can also chat with @coach.ai, @comic.ai, and @poet.ai.

    - Unbounded Chat only responds to your messages.
    - Unsolicited marketing messages are not sent to your number or email, but free plan messages may contain sponsorship links.
