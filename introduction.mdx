## iCendant Empathy™ - Empathy Echoed, Enhanced, Embodied (In Early Access)

Are you working on a coaching, meditation, or other application that requires empathy? Try [iCendant Empathy](./empathy). Empathetic textual dialog alone is hard, using text-to-speech to generate high quality empathetic audio is even harder.
Leverage all the insights gained from [LLM empathy benchmarking](https://hackernoon.com/search?query=anywhichway%20emptathy%20emotion) by using iCendant Empathy.

- The first multi-modal LLM (text/biometric in and text/image/audio out) specifically designed for empathy as either part of your pipeline or for direct engagement.
- Developed in partnership with [Speechify](https://www.speechify.com), who provides the core AI voices for long and medium form speech enhancement by iCendant Empathy.

### Intelligence and Empathy - Generated by iCendant Empathy

<img src="./assets/images/intelligence-and-empathy.png" alt="Intelligence and Empathy poem" title="Intelligence and Empathy, generated by iCendant Empathy"/>

```
Intelligence, a mind so bright, a tool so sharp, without light.
It calculates, it knows, it sees, yet misses the heart's gentle pleas.
In logic's grip, it stands apart, a flower that blooms without a heart.
It solves problems, vast and wide, but neglects the human side.
It's cold, a journey without a soul to hold.
It builds towers high and grand, yet in isolation, it cannot stand.
For true wisdom, a balance we need, the mind and heart in mutual part.
```

### After great pain, a formal feeling comes - By Emily Dickinson

```
After great pain, a formal feeling comes
The Nerves sit ceremonious, like Tombs
The stiff Heart questions 'was it He, that bore,'
And 'Yesterday, or Centuries before'?
The Feet, mechanical, go round
A Wooden way
Of Ground, or Air, or Ought
Regardless grown,
A Quartz contentment, like a stone
This is the Hour of Lead
Remembered, if outlived,
As Freezing persons, recollect the Snow
First Chill then Stupor then the letting go
```
