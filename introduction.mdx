## iCendant Empathy™ (In Early Access)

Are you working on a coaching, meditation, or other application that requires empathy? Try [iCendant Empathy](./empathy). Empathetic textual dialog alone is hard, using text-to-speech to generate high quality empathetic audio is even harder.
Leverage all the insights gained from [LLM empathy benchmarking](https://hackernoon.com/search?query=anywhichway%20emptathy%20emotion) by using iCendant Empathy.

- The first multi-modal LLM (text/biometric in and text/image/audio out) specifically designed for empathy as either part of your pipeline or for direct engagement.
- Developed in partnership with [Speechify](https://www.speechify.com), who provides the core AI voices for long and medium form speech enhancement by iCendant Empathy.

Intelligence and Empathy - Generated by iCendant Empathy

<img class="icendant-example" src="./assets/images/intelligence-and-empathy.png" alt="Intelligence and Empathy poem" title="Intelligence and Empathy, generated by iCendant Empathy"/>

Intelligence, a mind so bright, a tool so sharp, without light. It calculates, it knows, it sees, yet misses the heart's gentle pleas.
In logic's grip, it stands apart, a flower that blooms without a heart. It solves problems, vast and wide, but neglects the human side.
It's cold, a journey without a soul to hold. It builds towers high and grand, yet in isolation, it cannot stand.
For true wisdom, a balance we need, the mind and heart in mutual part.
