iCendant Speech, The Voice of Emotion, provides a simple API for the generation of emotionally nuanced speech that automatically adjusts pitch, cadence, and volume based on a persona you provide with a choice of over 500 voices.

iCendant Speech uses the same engine as iCendant Empathy to enhance voices by Speechify but is not restricted to generating empathetic audio.

At &dollar;0.008 per 1,000 characters plus a low monthly fee of &dollar;15 per month, iCendant Speech is 10% of the typical cost of Hume and 2x the speed.
